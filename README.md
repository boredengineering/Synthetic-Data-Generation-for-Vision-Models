# Synthetic-Data-Generation-for-Vision-Models
 A collection of methods to generate Synthetic Data for Vison Models.

The learning objective is to evaluate several ways to leverage Synthetic Data Generation for training and finitunning several Vision Models

The files: model.onnx and model.pth too big for Github

## TO-DO

Must develop a stable pipeline to deploy the following resources from NGC:
- Nucleus Server
- Farm Server
- Triton Inference Server

Must implement the examples from Megatron-DeepSpeed such as: ViT and more ....

Must implement the SLURM cluster.

Must implement educational models like Andrej Karpathy minGPT but adapted for vision and several research papers.

## Nvidia Omniverse Replicator
NVIDIA Omniverse Replicator streamlines synthetic data generation (SDG) using 3D assets into a single application.
